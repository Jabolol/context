> Presential Hackathon in Barcelona April `14th` & `15th` 2023 at `Barcelona`.

Over the course of two days our team, integrated by
[xRozzo](https://github.com/xRozzo),
[Alex Alra Arteaga](https://github.com/alex-alra-arteaga) and
[Jabolol](https://github.com/Jabolol), designed and created this idea, rising to
the highest ranking.

We are thrilled to have had the opportunity to showcase our skills and
contribute to the growth of the `web3` ecosystem. This hackathon was a great
experience for our team, and we look forward to participating in future web3
